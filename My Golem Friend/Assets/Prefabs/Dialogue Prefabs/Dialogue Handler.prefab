      leave.
    - He mentioned that there were places around The Vale that might have some clues
      that could help you out.
    - You recall seeing an old scroll in one of the Graveyard towers when you were
      there with him last.

    - There it is, your pride and joy.
    - Perhaps not as glorious as you were wishing for, but none-the-less, it's a
      start.
    - Godrick strictly forbid you from touching the golem while he is away.
    - "He said things like, \u201CIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201D and \u201Cyou don\u2019t
      know enough yet!\u201D"
    - Something along those lines.
    - "Of course, you don\u2019t plan on listening to him."
    - "After all, this is a great opportunity to show Godrick just how much you\u2019ve
      grown!"
    - 
    - The first order of business is getting the golem powered with a core.
    - Godrick was helping you with a  recipe for one before he left, perhaps he left
      it here?

    - "Oh please don\u2019t start this, Godrick warned me too!"
    - Who Godrick?
    - My teacher.
    - What teacher?
    - You spend some time teaching the golem about different words.
    - The conversation deviates almost constantly and after a while you begin to
      feel your head spin.
    - And that is what happened to the world.
    - Interesting.
    - Very! Now if you excuse me, I have some more recipes to find and ingredients
      to harvest.
    - "I\u2019ll be back soon, feel free to take a look around the house, but don\u2019t

    - I guess you can do that since your eyes are obsidian.
    - Warm.
    - It is nice out today. Mind if I sit with you?
    - No.
    - You take a seat next to the golem, telling it about your travels around The
      Vale today.
    - The evening sun fills you with a drowsy feeling, causing you to doze off for
      a while.
    - You awake some time later, leaning up against the side of the Golem, who is
      still enjoying the sun.
    - You stand and stretch, wishing you could go back to sleep.
